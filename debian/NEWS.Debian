gtest (1.6.0-1) unstable; urgency=low
  
  Use of precompiled libgtest is no longer recommended.  See README.Debian
  for instructions on using gtest with your projects.  The precompiled
  shared library has been removed and the static library will be removed
  in a future upload.
  
  The script gtest-config is no longer supplied since upstream's
  autoconfigure-based build is deprecated.
